    <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Him Kumari Gurung well known as Kripa , and I am an aspiring front-end developer currently living in  Japan. I hold permanent residency here and have been living in Japan for almost five years. I can speak Japanese and I have cleared JLPT N3 Level .</p>
<br>

<p>I graduated with a degree in Business Studies but have always been passionate about computers and technology. I worked as a lower secondary-level computer teacher in Nepal for seven years, which gave me a strong foundation in programming, hardware setup, and teaching computer science concepts such as QBasic, C++, and HTML.</p>
<br>

<p>HTML has always been my specialization, and my career in technology began with it. My first job was an opportunity to showcase the HTML skills I learned at an institution, which became a milestone in my journey into technology.</p>
<br>

<p>Currently, I am studying full-stack development through Udemy and have completed seventy-five percent of the course. I also have experience working with the command line, such as creating folders, making directories, and navigating file systems. While I am new to both front-end and back-end development, I focus on mastering front-end technologies like HTML and JavaScript without overwhelming myself. My goal is to start my career as a junior front-end developer and grow my skills from there.</p>
<br>

<p>On a personal note, I live here with my four-year-old daughter and Husband . Balancing family life and my career aspirations has taught me resilience, time management, and adaptabilityâ€”qualities that I bring to my work as I pursue my dream of becoming a front-end developer.</p>
